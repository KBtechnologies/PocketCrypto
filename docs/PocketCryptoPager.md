### "PocketCrypto as Pager"



## Summary:
### Using
- PocketCrypto as airgapped crypto device
- a analog CB radio transciever as a common off-the-shelf transciever 
allow for a flexible two-ray, local messaging system that is:
- end-to-end encrypted
- anonymous and
- only allows for localization and deanonymization at transmission



### Reasons:
1.	Centralized Single-Vendor/Single-Provider messaging services are per law required to integrate "lawful interception" & Govware to spy on users.
- Rardless of legitimacy and rationale, these are utterly invasive and inacceptable per concept.


2.	Even Decentralized, [IP-bound] messaging services/solutions that allow to encrypt classic communications suffer from the same issues.
- Goverments make it nearly impossible if not illegal to obtain anonymous means of communications. 
  - i.e. [Germany banned anonymous SIM Cards in 07/2017](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11540689)
- Running Communication Servers without Govware-Backdoor is a felony in some juristinctions based off user count. 
- Internet Backbones are subject to legal and illegal surveillance across the globe.


3. CB Radio, despite being dated, is widely unregulated - aside from the transcievers being approved designs. 
- Even if ever banned, there are millions of devices in circulations, and DIYing a transmitter is trivial. 
- Also even low-clost SDR Transcievers [i.e. YARD Stick One or HackRF] could be used. 
- Even lower-cost Recievers [i.e. RTL-SDR] would allow one-way recieval of messages. 

4. AFSK is a trivial way to modulate/demodulate data on voice communications, such as analog radio. 
- A simple program and a soundcard is all that is needed.


5. Raspberry Pi Zero is fast enough to perform public/private crypto like RSA-4096.


6. It is vital to have off-grid communications 
- [see 1-2]
  - True Decentralization requires Users to Own Infrastructure


7. A cheap and simple appliance is needed that requires the least possible amount of "tech-literacy"


8. Create a modern take on the [SY-5000](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/spy/fs5000/) & Enigma.


9. Rights need to be exercised, or they will be revoked without any chance of meaningful resistance.
